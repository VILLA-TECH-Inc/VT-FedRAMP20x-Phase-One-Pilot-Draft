Overlays provide a specification of security or privacy controls, control enhancements, supplemental guidance, and other supporting information as part of the tailoring process, that is intended to complement (and further refine) security control baselines. The overlay may be more stringent or less stringent than the original security control baseline and can be applied to multiple information systems.\""

The use of capabilities simplifies how the protection problem is viewed conceptually. Using the construct of a capability provides a method of grouping controls that are employed for a common purpose or to achieve a common objective.\" This section later states \"Ultimately, authorization decisions (i.e., risk acceptance decisions) are made based on the degree to which the desired capabilities have been effectively achieved.\""
